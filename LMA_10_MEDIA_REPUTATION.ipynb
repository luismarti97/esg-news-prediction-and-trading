**reputation score** to each media source within each sector, based on how often the source appears.\n","\n","### Key operations:\n","\n","- **Filtering only cited news**: We remove news articles with missing \"sector\" or \"source\" fields, as both are essential for reputation analysis.\n","- **Counting source appearances per sector**: Using `groupby([\"sector\", \"source\"]).size()`, we compute how many times each source is cited in each sector.\n","- **Sorting**: We sort the sources in descending order of frequency within each sector.\n","\n","### Reputation score logic:\n","\n","- A function `reputacion_escalada(x)` is created:\n","  - If a source has **30 or more** articles, it is assigned the **maximum reputation score (1)**.\n","  - If it has **fewer than 30** articles, its reputation score is **scaled between 0.5 and 1** using a **logarithmic scaling** based on the number of appearances.\n","\n","The logarithmic scaling smooths the increase in reputation, ensuring that a small difference in article counts does not cause disproportionately large changes in reputation.\n","\n","### Justification:\n","\n","- **Reflects trustworthiness and relevance**: Highly cited sources are assumed to be more reputable or influential within their sector.\n","- **Avoids overfitting to extreme values**: The logarithmic transformation prevents large differences between medium and large sources.\n","- **Enables weighting in downstream models**: Later on, this reputation score can be used to modulate the impact of a news article depending on the reliability of its source.\n","\n","This scoring system gives a nuanced and dynamically scaled reputation to media sources based on their empirical relevance, improving the robustness of subsequent analyses and
