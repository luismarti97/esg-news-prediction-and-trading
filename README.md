# ESG News Prediction and Trading

This project presents a full pipeline for ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) signal extraction and investment strategy generation based on financial news using NLP models and LSTM networks.

## üìä Overview

This repository contains all the notebooks, models, and data pipelines developed as part of a master's thesis focused on building a **dynamic ESG scoring system** and a **signal-based investment algorithm**, using:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with RoBERTa and LLMs (GPT-4o)
- **LSTM** networks for time series forecasting of ESG scores
- **Streamlit app** for ESG score dashboards and signal simulation
- **Vertex AI** for scalable model training and deployment
