RoBERTa captures the semantic and syntactic relationships in the news articles, providing a rich representation of each token.\n","\n","- **Attention and Processing Block**:  \n","  To further refine the embeddings, a Multi-Head Attention mechanism with four heads is applied to the token representations. A residual connection and Layer Normalization are introduced after the attention operation, promoting stable and efficient learning.  \n","  Subsequently, a small feedforward network (position-wise dense layer with ReLU activation and dropout) is applied, again followed by a residual connection and Layer Normalization.  \n","  This design mimics the internal structure of standard Transformer encoders, allowing the model to enhance important signals in the text while maintaining computational efficiency.\n","\n","- **Final Classification Head**:  \n","  After the sequence processing, a mean pooling operation aggregates the information across the token dimension into a single fixed-size vector per article.  \n","  This vector is passed through a fully connected layer with ReLU activation and dropout for regularization, followed by a final output layer that produces logits for the three ESG classes (Environmental, Social, Governance).\n","\n","### Key Advantages\n","\n","The inclusion of an attention block with residual connections and normalization significantly improves the model's ability to focus on critical parts of the news while preserving long-range dependencies within the text.  \n","This architecture seeks to boost the model’s capability to capture fine-grained ESG signals embedded in financial and corporate narratives, leading to more accurate and robust

set to be trainable.  \n","- All earlier layers are frozen to preserve the general linguistic representations already learned and to reduce computational cost and risk of overfitting.\n","\n","This

**Optimizer**: AdamW optimizer is used with a learning rate of \\( 2 \\times 10^{-5} \\), which is a standard choice for fine-tuning transformer-based architectures.\n","- **Loss Function**:
